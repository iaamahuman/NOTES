Biology 101: Cell Biology Study Guide
=====================================

Course: Introduction to Cell Biology
Semester: Spring 2024
Professor: Dr. Maria Rodriguez
Topic: Cell Structure and Function

Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells
-------------------------------

Prokaryotes (Bacteria & Archaea):
- No membrane-bound nucleus
- Genetic material freely floating in cytoplasm
- Simple internal structure
- Ribosomes: 70S (30S + 50S subunits)
- Cell wall present (peptidoglycan in bacteria)

Eukaryotes (Animals, Plants, Fungi, Protists):
- Membrane-bound nucleus
- Complex organelle system
- Ribosomes: 80S (40S + 60S subunits)
- Endomembrane system present

Major Organelles and Functions
------------------------------

1. Nucleus
   - Control center of the cell
   - Contains DNA organized into chromosomes
   - Nuclear envelope with nuclear pores
   - Nucleolus: ribosome assembly site

2. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
   - Rough ER: studded with ribosomes, protein synthesis
   - Smooth ER: lipid synthesis, detoxification
   - Continuous with nuclear envelope

3. Golgi Apparatus
   - Modifies, packages, and ships proteins
   - Cis face (receives from ER) â†’ Trans face (ships out)
   - Forms lysosomes and secretory vesicles

4. Mitochondria
   - Powerhouse of the cell
   - ATP synthesis via cellular respiration
   - Double membrane structure
   - Contains own DNA and ribosomes

5. Ribosomes
   - Protein synthesis machinery
   - Two subunits: large and small
   - Free ribosomes: cytoplasmic proteins
   - Bound ribosomes: membrane/secreted proteins

6. Lysosomes (Animal cells)
   - Digestive organelles
   - Contain hydrolytic enzymes
   - Autophagy and phagocytosis
   - pH ~4.5 (acidic environment)

Plant-Specific Organelles
------------------------

1. Chloroplasts
   - Site of photosynthesis
   - Thylakoid membranes contain chlorophyll
   - Stroma: site of Calvin cycle
   - Double membrane structure

2. Vacuoles
   - Large central vacuole for turgor pressure
   - Storage of water, ions, and metabolites
   - Maintains cell structure and rigidity

3. Cell Wall
   - Cellulose-based structural support
   - Provides protection and shape
   - Plasmodesmata: connections between cells

Cytoskeleton Components
-----------------------

1. Microfilaments (Actin)
   - Thinnest fibers (~7 nm)
   - Cell shape and movement
   - Muscle contraction

2. Intermediate Filaments
   - Medium size (~10 nm)
   - Structural support
   - Nuclear lamins, keratins

3. Microtubules (Tubulin)
   - Largest fibers (~25 nm)
   - Organize organelles
   - Form cilia and flagella
   - Mitotic spindle formation

Cell Transport Mechanisms
-------------------------

Passive Transport:
- Diffusion: high to low concentration
- Osmosis: water movement across membrane
- Facilitated diffusion: channel/carrier proteins

Active Transport:
- Primary: directly uses ATP (Na+/K+ pump)
- Secondary: uses electrochemical gradient
- Endocytosis: bringing materials into cell
- Exocytosis: expelling materials from cell

Membrane Structure
------------------

Fluid Mosaic Model:
- Phospholipid bilayer
- Embedded proteins (integral and peripheral)
- Cholesterol modulates fluidity
- Glycoproteins and glycolipids (cell recognition)

Key Properties:
- Selective permeability
- Maintains concentration gradients
- Signal transduction capability

Laboratory Techniques
--------------------
- Light microscopy (up to 1000x magnification)
- Electron microscopy (TEM and SEM)
- Cell fractionation and centrifugation
- Fluorescence labeling of organelles

Study Questions:
1. Compare structure and function of rough vs smooth ER
2. Explain the endosymbiotic theory for mitochondria and chloroplasts
3. Describe the pathway of protein synthesis and trafficking
4. Analyze osmotic effects on plant and animal cells
5. Distinguish between different types of membrane transport
