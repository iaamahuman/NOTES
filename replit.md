# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom design system using CSS variables
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution in development
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware for handling multipart/form-data
- **Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration
- **API**: RESTful API design with JSON responses

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Schema Management**: Shared schema definitions between client and server
- **Current Implementation**: Memory-based storage for development with database migration path ready

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple) configured but not yet implemented
- **Current State**: Basic user structure defined in schema without active authentication

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (PostgreSQL) via @neondatabase/serverless
- **File Storage**: Local file system with configurable upload directory
- **UI Framework**: Extensive Radix UI component ecosystem
- **Development Tools**: Replit integration with cartographer and runtime error overlay
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type checking and schema validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation and formatting

## Key Design Decisions

### Monorepo Structure
The application uses a monorepo pattern with clear separation:
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express backend API
- `shared/` - Common TypeScript types and schemas
- Path aliases configured for clean imports across the application

### Type Safety
- End-to-end TypeScript with strict configuration
- Shared schema definitions using Drizzle and Zod
- Type-safe API client with proper error handling

### Scalability Considerations
- Interface-based storage layer allows easy migration from memory to database
- Drizzle ORM configuration ready for PostgreSQL deployment
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- Proper separation of concerns between data access, business logic, and presentation

### Development Experience
- Hot module replacement with Vite
- Comprehensive UI component library
- Form validation with immediate feedback
- Error boundary and runtime error handling
- Mobile-responsive design patterns
